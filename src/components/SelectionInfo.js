                Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting 
                algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the
                list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end
                and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted 
                part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.The smallest
                element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the 
                leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted 
                array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by 
                one element to the right.This algorithm is not suitable for large 
                data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2), 
                where n is the number of items.
